This is Vanilla Animated Guns, a fantasy-ish gun mod that proves guns can have their place in Minecraft!

You might be wondering if there aren't already gun mods for Minecraft. And while yes, Vanilla Animated Guns is a mod with a unique approach, aiming to go in a different direction from most gun mods. Unlike other gun mods which tend to be either too complex and detailed, or too boring and underwhelming, this mod was designed as a compromise between both approaches, in order to fit seamlessly with Minecraft's simplicity and aesthetic whilst not compromising the fun aspects such as animations or controls.

This mod does not have fancy workbenches, highly detailed models, out-of-place attachment systems, gore, or over-the-top animations. Instead, it tries to follow Mojang's vision of what would theoretically be in an update, according to their vague policies.

And, as a fork of MrCrayfish's Gun Mod, this gun mod inherits much of the simplicity that comes with it. And whilst CGM is already Minecrafty enough, this mod strips it down to its very foundations in order to make it feel like a truly vanilla experience.

> Types of Ammunition
In this mod, there are three types of ammunition:

Powdered Pellet: The first type of ammunition you will most likely use in this mod. This is the main ammunition for the Handcannon, the Musket, and the Sidehammer.
Bolt: This is the second type of ammunition you may or may not use in this mod, depending on your playstyle. The bolt is responsible for feeding the fully automatic firearms, such as the Minimach and the Boltcaster.
Shell: This is a special type of ammunition, made specifically for the Boomstick.
Dynamite: Although considered a type of ammunition for the Dynamite Launcher, the dynamite sticks can also be used independently and thrown by hand, although it has a fuse time before it can explode. Unlike TNT, these sticks only affect entities, and do not grief blocks.

> List of Firearms
Each firearm has its own class and purpose. Their descriptions are as follows:

Handcannon
Base Damage: 4 | Base Capacity: 6/6

The initial weapon. Meant as an introductory weapon, it can be quite versatile early-game, allowing you to kill most mobs with a few shots, although it's not very useful in PvP due to its weak damage. Cheap to craft, it can be used with a shield, making it one of the only two ranged weapons in the game you can use with a shield.
 
Musket
Base Damage: 18 | Base Capacity: 1/1

Along with the pistol, this is the second weapon you can unlock in the game during early game. It can reach up to 27 damage when enchanted. However, even when enchanted, this weapon has a big cooldown before you can shoot again, with its enchanted cooldown being 15 seconds on average, while its unenchanted cooldown sits around 20 seconds. Every projectile in this mod can be deflected by shields, and the Musket isn't always accurate, so always make sure that every shot counts. 
 
Sidehammer
Base Damage: 7 | Base Capacity: 8/8

The third weapon you unlock during the normal progression, being the first diamond-tier weapon, and the first proper rifle you acquire in the mod. It's able to reach up to 10.5 in damage with enchantments, and can be used as a sniper rifle to shoot from afar with considerable precision. Its main trade-off compared to the Musket is damage in exchange for precision and speed, making it ideal for finishing off weak opponents. This is also the last weapon that uses Powdered Pellet as ammunition.
 
Minimach
Base Damage: 3.5 | Base Capacity: 20/20

This redstone-powered machine is the first fully automatic weapon you can craft. Slightly more expensive than the Handcannon, this firearm not only has a high fire rate, it is also the most precise weapon in the mod, having no spread whatsoever. Its fire rate and precision come at the expense of considerable recoil and low damage, however. It's also the first weapon to use bolts as ammunition, which is a new tier of pointy flint ammunition encased in copper hulls. It is also one-handed, making it effectively the Minecraft equivalent of a Micro SMG.
 
Boomstick
Base Damage: 9.5 | Base Capacity: 2/2

A devastating close-range weapon, the Boomstick presents plenty of risk and reward. Being the first netherite-tier weapon, its reinforced netherite structure allows for the loading of shells, a special kind of ammunition that merges the concepts of Bolts and Powdered Pellets to encase basalt pellets into a copper hull, allowing for projectile dispersion and crowd control of big groups of mobs.
 
Boltcaster
Base Damage: 6.5 | Base Capacity: 30/30

The Boltcaster is an endgame weapon, having high accuracy at long range and an abundant supply of ammunition to feed its fully automatic system. Ideal for hitting fast-moving targets, this weapon is effective at all engagement distances, and is best used against a solitary target, unless a Collateral enchantment is present. Unlike the Minimach, its recoil is manageable, due to its slower fire rate than the Minimach.
 
Dynamite Launcher
Base Damage: 15 | Base Capacity: 1/1

This is a post-endgame weapon, crafted with a nether star and a Boltcaster, meaning it's impossible to get one before finishing the game. It is by far the most damaging weapon, and its potential is huge, as it can shoot dynamite sticks much further away than what you can by throwing it manually. Dynamite sticks shot with this launcher also explode on touch, making it an essential tool for those who likes explosions. It can go even further with the right enchantments, making it effectively a death beam.
